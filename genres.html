          <h2>contemporary</h2>
          <p>
            Contemporary is an important genre of dance that was developed
            during the 20th century and involves incorporating aspects of
            movement from other genres such as jazz, modern and ballet. Unlike
            traditional forms of dance, contemporary is considered to be
            somewhat unbound by much rigidity and rules. The dancers have the
            ability to transform a performance based on their own
            interpretations.

          <h2>ballet</h2>
          <p>
            Ballet dance is a traditional art form that originated over 500
            years ago in Italy. It was first performed by nobility in rarified
            spaces, and is now one of the most well-known forms of the
            performing arts. Ballet dancers are trained to appear gentle and
            graceful in their movements, while their technique requires a lot of
            strength, balance, technical skill, and flexibility.

          <h2>hip hop</h2>
          <p>
            Hip hop dance is a range of street dance styles primarily performed
            to hip hop music or that have evolved as part of hip hop culture. It
            is influenced by a ange of styles that were created in the 1970s and
            made popular by dance crews in the United States. What distinguishes
            it from other forms of dance is that it is often "freestyle" in
            nature.
