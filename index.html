    <h1 class="thick">YOU CAN DANCE</h1>
    <h2 class="thick">Dance: The movement of the body</h2>
    <p> 
      Dance,  the  movement  of  the  body  in  a  rhythmic  way,  usually  to  music  and
      within  a  given  space,  for  the  purpose  of  expressing  an  idea  or  emotion, 
       releasing  energy,  or  simply  taking  delight  in  the movement  itself. Dance  is
       a  powerful  impulse,  but  the  art  of  dance  is  that  impulse  channeled  by
       skillful  performers  into  something  that  becomes  intensely  expressive  and
       that  may  delight  spectators  who  feel no wish to dance themselves. These
      two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as
      a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are
      the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration
      of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is
      stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the
      other.Although the above broad definition covers all forms of the art,
      philosophers and critics throughout history have suggested different
      definitions of dance that have amounted to little more than descriptions
      of the kind of dance with which each writer was most familiar. Thus,
      Aristotle’s statement in the Poetics that dance is rhythmic movement whose
      purpose is “to represent men’s characters as well as what they do and
      suffer” refers to the central role that dance played in classical Greek
      theatre, where the chorus through its movements reenacted the themes of
      the drama during lyric interludes.

    <li><h4 class="hk">Weight and Metabolism:</h4>

            <p>Dance exercises combined with healthy nutrition will help you lose weight, boost your metabolism and stay in shape! However not all dances are the same when it comes to this topic. Usually it’s all about calories and how many of them you can burn during the class. So dancing Tango will probably won’t help you a lot in this case, whereas salsa or hip hop will bring your weight down a lot faster. Just follow the link to learn which dance styles are best for weight loss. One word of caution though, choose a dance style which makes you happy and you actually want to practice even if it’s not as energy intensive as you hoped it would be. Mental stress and self hatred leads to obesity a lot more often than an extra bite of some delicious food.</p>
    <li><h4 class="hk">Posture and Blood Flow:</h4>
      It tones your muscles, and improves posture and blood flow, which in turn boosts your immune system and overall health. For many of us it is very difficult to have a great posture with all the cell phone and computer time we have to spend daily either at work or at home. However on your dance classes and related social events of any kind you’ll be more aware about how you hold your back, you head, shoulders and so on. It won’t take as much mental stress and will power as it would if you chose to hold you back straight all of a sudden without any special reason or purpose.

      And yes, good posture will align your bones and joints and it will indeed improve the blood flow to your head and other important areas of your body properly oxygenating internal organs and making you healthier. Nice bonus, right?</li>
    <li><h4 class="hk">Perfect Age:</h4>

          <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>You don’t need to be a certain age. Any age is perfect to start dancing! At any age such physical activity will bring lots positive changes to your body and soul! As an adult it may seem difficult at first to make yourself go to your first dance class. If you’ve never danced before you’ll will probably be very self-conscious, shy and worry a lot about it, but you shouldn’t. Many adults who have never danced in their life come to dance classes in their 30s, 40s and 50s these days. It’s totally normal and there is nothing to be hesitant about. If you want to dance – just do it.

              If you are in your 60s or older you should still come to dance classes and enjoy your life as a dance student, however keep in mind that some dance styles require you to have a good physical health. It’s up you and probably your doctor (in case you have a certain health condition) to decide which dance style is more suitable for you. Argentine Tango or Bachata for example are just great for seniors. However Hip-hop or Zumba would probably be too much.</p>
